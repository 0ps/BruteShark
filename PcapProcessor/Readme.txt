BruteShark is a Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT) that performs deep processing and inspiction of a network traffic (mainly PCAP files). It includes: password extracting, building a network map, reconstract TCP sessions, extract hashes of encrypted passwords and even convert them to a Hashcat format in order to perform an offline Brute Force attack.

The main goal of the project is to provide solution to security researchers and network administrators with the task of network traffic analysis while they try to identify weaknesses that can be used by a potential attacker to gain access to critical points on the network.

BruteShark comes in two versions A GUI based application (Windows) and a Command Line Interface tool (Windows and Linux).  

The project was developed in my spare time to address two main passions of mine: software arichtecture and analyzing network data.
